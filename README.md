# Shopping List Organizer (QVAC)

Paste a messy shopping list ("milk, 2 bananas, dish soap, frozen peas...") and an **on-device AI** sorts every item into a **store aisle**: produce, bakery, dairy, frozen, pantry and more, in the order you walk the store. Tick things off as they go in the cart, move anything to another aisle, add forgotten items, and print or copy the list.

It runs **on your own computer** using [QVAC](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac), Tether's open-source AI SDK.
No API key, no cloud service, and what you type never leaves your machine.

## SDK version

`@qvac/sdk` **0.19.0** (declared in `package.json`)

Functions used: `loadModel` and `completion` (with structured output via `responseFormat`), with the `LLAMA_3_2_1B_INST_Q4_0` model.

## Install

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 22 or newer and some free disk space for the model.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/misaki-codex/qvac-shopping-list-organizer.git
cd qvac-shopping-list-organizer
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

Then open **http://localhost:3058** (the address, not the HTML file). The first start downloads the model.
While it loads, items are sorted by keywords instead, so it always works.

## How it works

- `server.js` calls `completion` with a JSON schema where the aisle must be one of 12 fixed names (an `enum`), so the AI can't invent aisles.
- **No item is ever lost:** if the AI skips an item, the server puts it back under "Other".
- Items you add later are placed by keyword guesses, and you can move them with the menu. Your list and ticks are saved in your browser, and Print shows a clean checklist.
- The server listens on `127.0.0.1`, so only your own computer can reach it.

## Troubleshooting

If you see `RPC_INIT_TIMEOUT`, the QVAC worker was slow to start. `server.js` already waits 3 minutes.
Set `QVAC_RPC_INIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (milliseconds) before `npm start` to wait longer, and make sure no other
QVAC app is running at the same time. If you see `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, delete the `node_modules` folder
and run `npm install` again (this usually means an install was interrupted, for example by a full disk).
